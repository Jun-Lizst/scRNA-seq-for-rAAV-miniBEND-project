# scRNA-seq-for-rAAV-miniBEND-project
This repository contains all the code and analysis pipelines used for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis in the rAAV-miniBEND project, as reported in our Nature Biomedical Engineering manuscript.

The rAAV-miniBEND system enables efficient and specific gene delivery to brain endothelial cells. This repository supports our in vivo validation of rAAV-miniBEND-based bAVM modeling by providing reproducible code for:

1. Quality control and filtering
2. Clustering and cell type annotation
3. Differential gene expression analysis
4. Visualization of endothelial cell-specific expression patterns

All scripts were developed in R (using Seurat and related packages) and Python.
